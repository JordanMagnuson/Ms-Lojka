Libraries:	Typed.js

The source code for this game is free and open. If you find it helpful, 
or make anything particular with it, I'd love to hear about it! 
Send an email to jordan@necessarygames.com.

Note: the libraries and assets used may be covered by their own licenses. 
Please see the credits, and libraries in question for more information.

I'm afraid the code is not very well commented, and involves several hacks.
For additional context regarding some of the challenges I faced with Twine 
and SugarCube (specifically with getting the various typing effects that I 
wanted to work), and some of the solutions I came up with,  see my Twine 
forum posts from March and April, 2016:
